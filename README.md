# Real_time-hand-gesture-recognition
To design a real-time human- computer interaction system based on six hand gesture. The whole system consists of three components: hand detection, gesture recognition and human-computer interaction (HCI) based on recognition
Hand detection:
Traning a hand detector using Tensorflow (Object Detection API) with Oxford Hands Dataset
